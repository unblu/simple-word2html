# simple-word2html
Simple to use word to html converter with very limited functionality.

Text can be copied from many sources in fact (it does not necessarily have to be Word). Most of the functionality is done by the browser itself. 

Has been tested on Google Chrome mainly - should work on most other modern browsers as well.
